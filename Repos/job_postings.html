		<h3>We’re always growing.</h3>
		<p>Most people think of Valve as a company that makes video games&#151;<br/>and we are.  But we also built the software that powers those games and the platform that lets millions of fans play, share, modify, and build communities around more than 1,800 titles.  That makes us a full-spectrum entertainment studio.  As such, our search for talent has taken us beyond the game industry and into the fields of architecture, economics, psychology, and industrial design.  We’re not just growing.  We’re diversifying.  Where to next?  You tell us.  We’re after talented people with original ideas and the passion to realize them.</p>
	    <p/>
		<h3>Help Us Grow In Europe</h3>
		<p>In August 2012, Valve opened its first European office &#151; in Luxembourg. We're thinking hard about our future presence in Europe, and actively looking for people with the right skills and passion to join our team. If you think you could make us better at supporting our international partners and projects, working from Seattle or from the EU, <a href='mailto:jobs-europe@valvesoftware.com'>contact us</a> to arrange a meeting in July at <a href="http://www.developconference.com/">Develop</a> in Brighton or in August at <a href="http://www.gdceurope.com/">GDC Europe</a> in Cologne. We're excited to hear from you!</p>

							<p>Valve’s multi-player games, as well as Steam (Valve’s successful trading platform), have allowed for the spontaneous emergence of complex virtual, yet quite real, economies. These economies are replete with rich trading patterns, fascinating ‘institutions’ (which have also sprung up organically), socio-economic conventions, and, generally, a host of economic phenomena that partly reflect what we observe in the analogue world and partly constitute new and unexplored behavioural patterns.</p>
							<p>The task of a Valve economist is to make good use of the incredible wealth of data concerning these social economies, to pose fresh questions about their workings, and to generate methods for converting new knowledge about these economic vistas into tangible ideas that help improve our customers’ experiences. </p>
